Hello Everyone! This is my first ever blog post, so be kind ;) 

Before starting at the Flatiron School I had spent the past eight years as a buyer in the fashion industry, working at Victoria Secret then New York & Company. When the pandemic hit I was the Lead Buyer for New York & Company's loungewear division, making buying decisions for 350+ brick and mortar stores as well as e-commerce.  Due to the pandemic NY&Co ultimately went out of business, which entail opened another door.

The decision to leave fashion behind and dive head first into software engineering was not one I took lightly.  However coding was always something that I had an interest in but never had the time to thoroughly explore working full time in the fashion industry.So in the midst of a professional crisis I decided to start learning Python on Code Academy and after a few weeks I was hooked! After some research into coding schools I chose to take the risk and applied to the Flatiron School, leaving everything I’ve ever known from a career standpoint behind to start on a new and exciting journey.

I’ve always enjoyed working with numbers, solving problems and collaborating with others towards a common goal.  With the first couple weeks behind me, I am more confident than ever this was the right decision. Eager to see what the next five months bring! 

Until next time,
Kerri
