Going back a couple years (about 12), in our High School yearbook we had to choose a word (if possible) to describe what got us to that day.  I chose the word 'perseverance'.  Not only in hindsight was that accurate for High School, but also something that grounds me during a trying time years later.

After being laid off from my dream job due to the pandemic, this is the word that pushed me to areas in my career I never imagined pursuing, kept me studying for hours on end at night and kept me reaching for goals I never thought I could achieve.  The last 6 months have been an amazing experience for me, I've learned an incredible amount from my peers and instructors.  Going from completing a handful of courses on codeacademy to becoming a full fledged Software Engineer.  I extended myself to limits that I never anticipated, working 12 plus hour days and weekends to ensure I was excelling and thoroughly understanding each module I was learning.  

Having pivoted after a seven year career as a Lead Buyer in the fashion industry and losing my job due to COVID, I am grateful for Flatiron and my cohort peers for the support and guidance they've given me during the course.  And ultimately, for understanding the necessity in life of perseverance.
